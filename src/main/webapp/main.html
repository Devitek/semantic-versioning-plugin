    <p> This feature allows you to reads the base version (Major, Minor, SNAPSHOT) settings from various build
        definition file formats. The plugin currently supports POM and SBT (Build.scala). SemanticVersioning uses the
        values parsed from the build definition files in conjunction with the Jenkins build number to create a Semantic
        Versioning string. The string is stored in an build-environment variable (name is configurable). Additionally
        the <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> string is written to a file in the Artifact directory.</p>
